# Pothi
Societies, Cultures and Open Data

* Version 1.0
* Updated 2023-04-03
* Contributors: Subhashish Panigrahi
* Hosted by: O Foundation

Hosted by the O Foundation, Pothi includes public and open datasets of various kinds related to communities and cultures, along with datasheets that provide details about the data collection process for any accountability and ethics audit. This repository includes a collection of databases that can be downloaded and used for research and other purposes.

The datasets could include information about notable people along with other identifying information such as their name variations, nationality, birth and death dates, professions, cultural/ethnic background, and details of family members. Each dataset also includes metadata such as the curation date and the data curator's details.

Our datasets are sometimes created by using publicly available data from relatively reliable sources such as government publications. However, we do not always have the means to verify independently the accuracy of the data. While we do our best to ensure that the information is accurate, up-to-date, and well-organized, you might still find mistakes, either from the source or through human errors on our end. Please [report](https://github.com/ofdn/Pothi/issues) any issue you might come across by providing more background and cite any useful information such as secondary sources. We hope that this open data repository can be a valuable resource for researchers and others.
